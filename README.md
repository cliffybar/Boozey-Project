## Objective

You’ve had a very long day. Perhaps, something at work was a nuisance. Or, you were stuck in traffic for way longer than you normally are. OR, you are a student at a Coding Boot Camp and you are faced with some of the greatest academic challenges of your life on a daily basis. 

You’re drained, frustrated, and in need of some “me” time. Self-care time, if you will. YOU are not alone. You ask yourself, “well, how can I mellow down, even if it’s just for a bit?” Boozey is your answer! 

With Boozey, you can mellow down (or buzz up) after a subpar day. Everyone deserves to disconnect from the harshness of their realities, especially in a pandemic, to once again have a little pep in your step. 

Take agency over how you define your day and get Boozey!
